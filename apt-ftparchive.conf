# DOCUMENTATION:
# 1. **Configuration Purpose**:
#    - This configuration file is used to manage Debian package archives, specifying directories, compression methods, and release details.

# 2. **Directory Structure**:
#    - `Dir { ArchiveDir "."; }`: Sets the base directory for the archive to the current directory.

# 3. **Compression Settings**:
#    - `Default { Packages::Compress ". gzip"; Sources::Compress ". gzip"; Contents::Compress ". gzip"; }`: Specifies that package, source, and contents files should be compressed using gzip.

# 4. **Archive Settings**:
#    - `Archive { Architectures "amd64"; Sections "main"; PDiffs "false"; }`: Defines the architecture as "amd64", section as "main", and disables PDiffs.

# 5. **Binary Directories**:
#    - `BinDirectory "dists/stable/main/binary-amd64" { Packages "dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages"; }`: Defines the directory for binary packages for the "stable" release.
#    - `BinDirectory "dists/bullseye/main/binary-amd64" { Packages "dists/bullseye/main/binary-amd64/Packages"; }`: Defines the directory for binary packages for the "bullseye" release.
#    - `BinDirectory "dists/buster/main/binary-amd64" { Packages "dists/buster/main/binary-amd64/Packages"; }`: Defines the directory for binary packages for the "buster" release.

# 6. **Source Directories**:
#    - `Tree "dists/stable/main/source" { Sources "dists/stable/main/source/Sources"; }`: Defines the directory for source packages for the "stable" release.
#    - `Tree "dists/bullseye/main/source" { Sources "dists/bullseye/main/source/Sources"; }`: Defines the directory for source packages for the "bullseye" release.
#    - `Tree "dists/buster/main/source" { Sources "dists/buster/main/source/Sources"; }`: Defines the directory for source packages for the "buster" release.

# 7. **Release Information**:
#    - `Default { Release { Architectures "amd64"; Components "main"; Origin "Walter V. Faustine"; Label "icodebible"; Suite "stable"; Codename "stable"; } }`: Sets default release information including architecture, components, origin, label, suite, and codename.

# 8. **Important Notes**:
#    - Ensure the directory structure matches the specified paths in the configuration.
#    - Verify that the compression methods are supported and correctly set for your environment.
#    - Update the release information as needed to reflect the correct origin, label, suite, and codename.

# 9. **Example Usage**:
#    - Place this configuration file in the appropriate location and run the relevant commands to manage the Debian package archives.
#    - Ensure the directory paths and release information are accurate and up to date.

# 10. **Expected Output**:
#    - Properly configured Debian package archives with the specified compression, directory structure, and release details.
